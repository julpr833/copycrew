## User Flow

1. **Sign Up / Log In**:

   - User starts by either signing up for a new account or logging into an existing one.

2. **Dashboard**:

   - After logging in, the user is directed to their dashboard.

3. **Dashboard Options**:

   - From the dashboard, the user can:
     - View their copypastes.
     - View their groups.
     - Create a new copypaste.
     - Create a new group.

4. **Manage Copypastes**:

   - Within copypastes:
     - User can view, edit, or delete their copypastes.

5. **Manage Groups**:

   - Within groups:
     - User can view group copypastes.
     - User can invite other users to join the group.
     - User can leave the group or delete the group if they are the owner.

6. **Log Out**:
   - Finally, the user has the option to log out of their account.

## User Authentication and Authorization:

- Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.
- Authentication will ensure that each user can only access their own copypastes and groups, providing security and privacy.
- Authorization will control access to certain features such as creating groups, inviting users to groups, etc.

## Database Schema:

- You'll need a database to store users, copypastes, and groups. Consider using a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- Here's a basic schema outline:
  - **User**:
    - id (primary key)
    - username
    - email
    - password (hashed)
  - **Copypaste**:
    - id (primary key)
    - title
    - categories
    - content
    - user_id (foreign key referencing User)
  - **Group**:
    - id (primary key)
    - name
  - **GroupMember**:
    - id (primary key)
    - group_id (foreign key referencing Group)
    - user_id (foreign key referencing User)

## Backend API:

- You'll need endpoints to handle CRUD operations for copypastes and groups.
- Endpoints should also manage user authentication and authorization.
- Sample endpoints:
  - `POST /api/register` - Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/login` - Log in an existing user.
  - `GET /api/copypastes` - Retrieve copypastes for the authenticated user.
  - `POST /api/copypastes` - Create a new copypaste.
  - `GET /api/groups` - Retrieve groups for the authenticated user.
  - `POST /api/groups` - Create a new group.
  - `POST /api/groups/:groupId/invite` - Invite a user to a group.
  - And more as needed.

## Frontend Development with SvelteKit:

- Create pages and components for user authentication, copypastes, groups, etc.
- Use SvelteKit's routing capabilities to navigate between different parts of the application.
- Implement forms for creating copypastes, creating groups, inviting users, etc.
- Handle user authentication and authorization on the client-side.

## User Interface and Experience:

- Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily manage their copypastes and groups.
- Implement validation for forms to ensure data integrity.
- Provide feedback to users for successful operations and error handling.

## Testing and Deployment:

- Test your application thoroughly to ensure functionality and security.
- Deploy your application to a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku.
- Monitor your application for any issues and perform regular maintenance.
